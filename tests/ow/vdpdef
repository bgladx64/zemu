;
;   Some default SMS VDP Register values
;                by Mike G.
;              4th March 2001
;
;   Many thanks to Jon, SMSC, Charles
;   MacDonald, and Richard Talbot-Watkins
;   for their sterling work in documenting
;   the SMS VDP functions.
;
;   Thanks also to Sean Young of msxnet.org
;   for his accurate and exhaustive TMS9918
;   document.
;
;   You should read these documents if you
;   want accurate VDP info - the comments
;   in this source are just a guide.
; 
;   The data should also apply to the SG-1000
;   except for those settings marked as SMS
;   only.
;---------------------------------------------

; Note:
;
; By "on SMS" or "SMS only" I mean "when SMS mode is set",
; i.e. when bit 2 of register 0 is set.
;
; By "on TMS9918" or "TMS9918 only" I mean "when TMS mode is set",
; i.e. when bit 2 of register 0 is reset.


; Register 0

.db %00000100		; byte to write to VDP register
.db %10000000		; register to write to (%1000xxxx where xxxx is reg. no.)


; BIT 76543210 (bit numbering, for those who don't know)
;    %xxxxxxxx
;
; "Set" means "make this bit equal to 1"
; "Reset" means "make this bit equal to 0"
;
; What each bit means:
;
; Bit 0 - Set to disable screen sync (causes TV to "roll" on a real SMS).
;     1 - Set to stretch screen to 33 columns on SMS. Set to enable mode 2 on TMS9918.
;     2 - Set to enable SMS display mode, reset to enable TMS9918 (SG-1000) type modes.
;     3 - Set to shift sprites left by 8 pixels (SMS only).
;     4 - Set to enable line interrupts (SMS only).
;     5 - Set to blank column 0, allows smooth horizontal scrolling (SMS only).
;     6 - Set to fix top two rows during horizontal scroll (SMS only).
;     7 - Set to fix right 8 columns during vertical scroll (SMS only).


; Register 1

.db %10000000
.db %10000001

; Bit 0 - Enable "zoomed sprites" - each sprite pixel is zoomed to 4 pixels giving 16x16 sprite.
;     1 - Enable "magnified sprites" - 8x16 sprites consisting of 2 tiles. (SMS only).
;         On the TMS9918, this bit sets a further level of zoom to give up to 32x32 sprites.
;     2 - Does nothing.
;     3 - Expand screen by 6 rows on SMS giving a 32x30 screen. Set to enable mode 3 on TMS9918.
;     4 - Expand screen by 4 rows on SMS giving a 32x28 screen. Set to enable mode 1 on TMS9918.
;     5 - Set to enable VSync interrupts on both SMS and TMS9918.
;     6 - Set to enable VDP display.
;     7 - Set to enable 16K VRAM, reset for 4K VRAM. This bit must *always* be set as the SMS
;         and SG-1000 consoles have 16K of VRAM.


; Register 2

.db %11111111
.db %10000010

;  Set name table address at $800 byte offset. Only bits 1, 2 and 3 are significant, so
;  a setting of %xxxx111x results in a name table address of %11100000000000, or $3800.

; Register 5

.db %11111111
.db %10000101

; Set base address of sprite attribute table. Only bits 1-6 are significant, so
; a setting of %x111111x results in an attribute table address of $11111100000000, or $3F00.
  
; Register 6

.db %11111111
.db %10000110

; Set base adress of sprite generator table on TMS9918.
; On the SMS, this address is used to select the base address of tiles used for
; sprites - only bit 2 is significant, so a setting of %xxxxx1xx results in a base
; address of $2000 and %xxxxx0xx results in a base address of $0000. This is needed
; because only 8 bits are used to set the tile number in the sprite attribute table,
; so it effectively acts as a "9th bit" for the tile address of *all* sprites.

; Register 7

.db %00000010
.db %10000111

; Two nibbles (4 bit words). The high nibble (bits 4-7) selects the palette colour used for text
; on the TMS9918, the low nibble (bits 0-3) selects the colour from the sprite palette to be used
; for the border (on both TMS9918 and SMS). In each case it's a number from 0 to 15.

; Register 8

.db %00000000
.db %10001000

; Selects horizontal scroll offset of column 0 in pixels from the left hand edge. (SMS only.)

; Register 9

.db %00000000
.db %10001001

; Selects vertical scroll offset. The value in this register indicates the line of the SMS display
; to be displayed on the top scanline of the TV picture. (SMS only.)

; Register 10

.db %00000000
.db %10001010

; Finally, register 10 selects the number of scanlines to occur between line interrupts (assuming line
; interrupts are enabled). (SMS only.)
