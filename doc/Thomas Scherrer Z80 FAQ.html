<b><big>Q-1:</big></b> I AND R REGISTERS.  What they do.



  <b>Answer:</b> I is the Interrupt page address register.

The Z-80 CPU can be operated in mode2 where an indirect call to any memory

location can be achieved in responce to an interrupt. The I register is used

for this purpose to store the high order 8-bits of the indirect address while

the interrupting device provides the lower 8-bits of the address. This

feature allows interrupt routines to be located anywhere in memory.



  <b>Answer:</b> R is the memory Refresh register.

The Z-80 CPU contains a memory refresh counter to enable dynamic memories

to be used with the same ease as static memories. Seven bits of this 8 bit

register are automatically incremented after each instruction fetch.

The eight bits will remain as programmed with the LD R,A instruction.

The data in the refresh counter is sent out on the lower portion of the

address bus along with a refresh control signal while the CPU is decoding

and executing the instruction. The programmer can load the R register for

testing purposes, but this register is normally NOT used by the programmer.

During refresh, the contents of the I register are placed on the upper

8 bits of the address bus.



-------



<b><big>Q-2:</big></b> I AND R REGISTERS.  Will EXX change them or is there only one copy

of them?



  <b>Answer:</b> There is only one copy of the I and R registers, EXX don't

affect I and R at all.



-------



<b><big>Q-3:</big></b> IM x instruction.  What does it do.



  <b>Answer:</b> IM0, IM1, IM2 sets the interrupt mode.



Mode 0: The interrupting device can insert any instruction on the data

bus and allow the CPU to execute it (the old 8080 mode, default mode).

The Z80 will execute any one-byte instruction properly like a RST xx.  Where

the 8080 would execute any instruction, the Z80 needs some external logic

to execute multi-byte instructions like CALL xxxx.



Mode 1: Is a simplified mode where the CPU automatically executes a

restart (RST) to location 0038h so that no external hardware is required

(the old PC content is pushed onto the stack, and returned with a regular

return instruction, RET.



Mode 2: Is the most powerful, in that it allows for an indirect call to

any location in memory. With this mode the CPU forms a 16-bit memory address

where the upper 8-bits are the content of register I and the lower 8-bits

are supplied by the interrupting device. This address points to the first of

two sequential bytes in a table where the address of the service routine is

located. The CPU automatically obtains the starting address and performs a

CALL to this address. The RETI is also used to return to the main programm.





-------



<b><big>Q-4:</big></b> On the LD (IX + %D),%D instruction, does the index byte come first?



  <b>Answer:</b> Yes the index byte comes first.



-------



<b><big>Q-5:</big></b> Are indexes (IX + %D) signed or unsigned?



  <b>Answer:+</b> Signed (2's complement) with range -128 to +127.



-------



<b><big>Q-7:</big></b> What reg does DJNZ affect?  Does it affect the flags or does it just

 test the register against zero?



  <b>Answer:+</b> DJNZ means "Decrement and Jump if Not Zero" this instruction uses only

the B register as a counter...

Example:  LD   B,100

loop:     NOP

          DJNZ loop   The nop will be executed 100 times.

Remember this form of jump is relative 8 bit only.



-------



<b><big>Q-8:</big></b> I need to know which rotates &amp; shifts go through the carry and which

ones don't; also if there are any that don't affect the carry at all I need to know it.



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Howard Goldstein:</b> - All of the rotate and shift operands _affect_ carry.

The real question is which rotates and shifts treat carry as a bit separate

from bit 7 (since the z-80 only recognizes 8 bit signed operands).

See the databook to see which instructions treat the carry flag as a unique

bit in a rotate operation (in shift operations the carry bit is always a unique bit).



<b>Thomas Scherrer:</b> - Check the Z80 syntax. It's growing, and now there are docs 

about the rotates &amp; shifts.



-------



<b><big>Q-9:</big></b> CPL is a ones complement of A?



  <b>Answer:</b> Unsigned complement, 11000111B will be 00111000B after execution of CPL



-------



<b><big>Q-10:</big></b> NEG is a twos complement?



  <b>Answer:</b> Yes 100 wil be -100, after execution of NEG.



-------



<b><big>Q-11:</big></b> How does DAA work?



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Dave Baldwin:</b> - DAA (Decimal Adjust Accumulator) adds a correction factor to

 the contents of the Accumulator so that it will properly represent the results of a Packed

BCD operation.  It uses the 'N' flag to determine whether the previous instruction was an

addition or subtraction.



<b>Thomas Scherrer:</b> - <a href="http://www.zophar.net/fileuploads/2/10810irctp/z80syntx.htm#DAA">See the Z80Syntax</a>



-------



<b><big>Q-12:</big></b> Do the RST instructions have any side effects?



  <b>Answer:</b> Well one side effect is that it's a one-byte CALL intstruction which means

 that it pushes the location of PC (Program Counter) onto the stack, so you can return later with RET.



CALL ADDRESS   MNEMONIC

-----------------------

0000h          RST 00h

0008h          RST 08h

0010h          RST 10h

0018h          RST 18h

0020h          RST 20h

0028h          RST 28h

0030h          RST 30h

0038h          RST 38h



-------



<b><big>Q-13:</big></b> What does RETI do?



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Dave Baldwin:</b> - RETI (Return from interrupt) pops the return address from the stack,

like RET.  RETI is also decoded by the Z80 peripheral chips (SIO, CTC, PIO, DMA) and tells

them to reset the interrupt daisy chain so the next interrupt can be accepted.



<b>Howard Goldstein:</b> - RETI acts like RET except that some zilog

perihpherals recognize the RETI instruction sequence (0xed, 0x4d) for

purposes of clearing their internal interrupt-pending flags.

This has repurcussions for the daisy-chain interrupt technique used by the z-80 family.



-------



<b><big>Q-14:</big></b> What does RETN do?



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Thomas Scherrer:</b> - This is a 'return' instruction used with the NON-maskable

hardware interrupt NMI.  It's special purpose is to restore the CPU's internal interrupt control

flags so that regular interrupts can be processed.  A NMI is a restart (CALL) to location 0066h.



-------



<b><big>Q-15:</big></b> I assume RRD and RLD rotate the number in HL.  Do they use or

affect the carry?



-------



<b><big>Q-16:</big></b> I need to know the effects of this class of instructions:



LDI, LDIR

CPI, CPIR

INI, INIR

OUTI, OTIR



-------



<b><big>Q-17:</big></b> When AF is pushed which goes lower on the stack, A or F?



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Dave Baldwin:</b> A is the high byte, F is the low.  If you 'PUSH AF' then 'POP BC',

 the contents of A will be in B and the contents of F will be in C.



-------



<b><big>Q-18:</big></b> I assume when HL is pushed the L register is lower.



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Dave Baldwin:</b> Yes. The low order byte is also lower on the stack when any 

of the 16-bit register pairs are pushed on the stack  (AF, BC, DE, HL, IX, IY, and PC).



-------



<b><big>Q-19:</big></b> I assume the stack is predecremented before putting pushed data

on it.  And postincremented after popping data.  This keeps the stack pointer pointing to the TOS.



-------



<b><big>Q-20:</big></b> When you do a RST  (or an interrupt in mode 1 or 2)

Do interrupts get disabled until the RETI?



  <b>Answer:</b> An RST instruction does not disable interrupts, though it can be used

as a response to an interrupt acknowledge in Mode 0.  Any interrupt that is acknowledged

by the CPU disables further maskable interrupts (/INT pin) until they are enabled by

the EI instruction.  The NMI (Non-maskable interrupt) can interrupt a maskable interrupt.



-------



<b><big>Q-21:</big></b> Can the NMI procedure be interrupted by an interrupt or by an NMI?



  <b>Answer:</b>



<b>Howard Goldstein:</b> - (a) The NMI cannot be interrupted by a maskable interrupt (/INT)

because the NMI is defined to atomically copy the IFF1 to IFF2 and then set IFF1 to 0.



<b>Howard Goldstein:</b> - (b) The NMI may be interrupted by another NMI.  Hardware is

responsible for ensuring the /NMI input is adequately processed to ensure

the NMI procedure is completed before another NMI is issued.

  Another thing to watch out for is the IFF2 state, when the second NMI begins.

It is lost, and that would f*ck up the old IE state when RETN runs

(RETN of course also restores IFF2 to IFF1) leaving the system with interrupts

disabled.  Makes it even more important to damp /NMI with hardware

(low pass filter?  one shot?)



<b>Thomas Scherrer:</b> - Use an RS-FlipFlop, so the /NMI can't be triggerd

before you reset(enable) the RS-FF, you can use a output port bit for this.



-------



<b><big>Q-22:</big></b> I assume DAA uses the N bit to do either an ADD adjustment or

        a SUBTRACT adjustment.



<b>Thomas Scherrer:</b> - <a href="http://www.zophar.net/fileuploads/2/10810irctp/z80syntx.htm#DAA">See the Z80Syntax under DAA</a>



-------



<b><big>Q-23:</big></b> What are the flags of RRD and RLD based on?  The new contents

        of A or the new contents of HL?



-------



<b><big>Q-24:</big></b> How is the HC flag set on IN instructions



-------



<b><big>Q-25:</big></b> On the CPIR and CPDR instructions, how are the flags

set on success?  On failure?  In particular I'm looking for the difference

between aborting when A = [HL] and aborting when BC = 0.
